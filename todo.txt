  + make a damageMonster function
    + Check for death on each hit
  + make attempting to move into a monster instead attack

- Stats system:
  + Add stats to Player in GameState
  + Make Stats a datatype deriving Ord
    = so we can quickly test stat reqs with >

- Skill system:
  - create datatype 'Skill'
  - active skills:
    - list = filter unlocked skills?
    - update every stat change
  - passive skills:
    - isUnlocked function, checked wherever it's relevant
      = ie when attacking, when attacked, etc

- Random generation:
  - want a function: dice :: Rng -> Int -> Int -> (Int, Rng) or similar
    = dice Rng numDice dieSize =
  - Should probably learn about monads

= Theme/Design:
  = Save sci-fi for future, AP-based game
  = Go with fantasy for now

  = Skills auto-unlocked by stat reqs
    = simpler UI
    = Stats:
      = Strength:
        = direct: melee dmg, HP
        = skills: lots of passives
          = regen, armor, etc
        = usually a "safe" thing to level up

      = Dexterity:
        = direct: tohit, dodge?, stamina?
        = skills;
          = fancy combat skills
          = utility: sprint, etc
        = primarily for phsyical combat builds
          = "value points" for utility

      = Power:
        = raw magic power
        = direct: MP max
        = skills: bigger booms
          = AoEs
          = nukes

      = Control:
        = magical skill
        = direct: 
          = magic tohit?/cast chance?
          = + buff duration
        = skills: fancy stuff
          = utility:
            = teleportation
            = invis
            = scrying
        = of some use to warriors for utility/piercing immunities
          
= Skill ideas:
  = Clairvoyant Strike:
    = bit of DEX, medium CTL?
    = small MP cost
    = see a moment into the future to predict opponent
    = undodgeable/unmissable strike
    = high crit chance
    = handy for melee warriors against high-evasion opponents

  = Blink:
    = short-range targeted teleport
    = limit to Line of Sight?
    = high CTL

  = Foresight:
    = Buff
    = bonus chance to dodge
    = low DEX, medium/high CTL
